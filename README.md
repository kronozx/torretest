Torre Internship Test

Issues:
- Sometimes when the sample size number is greater than 1000, it throws an error. It may be some kind of issue regarding the requests to the API (Torre API rejects requesting more than 5000 results). Will keep looking the bug and see if it's possible to fix it before 24 hrs deadline.
